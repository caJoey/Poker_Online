// to go from WSL 1 to WSL 2 in powershell:
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 1

// for both:
npm install
npm start

Plus show if:
Player is not at the table

Player info shows if:
Player is at the table

How to do socket:
Client:
 - Client does a useEffect on the Socket
Server:
Every time a player updates, socket sends the following object:
{
    0: {playerInfo}
}

how it should work:
1. new player enters table, current state is shown, along with '+' for empty seats
2. when player clicks seat, enters seat, '+' disappears

What is a player? (at table)
1. name
2. chips
3. current betsize
4. seat number
5. is their turn?
5.5. is sitting out?
6. clock
7. How large of a bet we facing

7. action type:
 - facing no raise (can check or bet)
 - facing a raise (can call, raise, fold)



Notes:
1. in heads up, SB == BTN, BB goes first after flop
2. if !gameStarted, it auto starts when we get above 
3. players leaving mid game (advanced / P1)
 - if BB plays then leaves, SB shouldn't pay SB again, they become BTN

Process of game start:
1. Game hasn't started
2. Second player joins, start game
3. Randomly pick btn:
 - 2 players == special case, SB == BTN, other is BB
 - >2 players == place btn, then SB and BB right after
4. Deal cards, each player receives unique player object which reveals only their two cards
5. Start first turn, player right after BB starts the action
6. ...

Every time a round starts, place active players into a different array
